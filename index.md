## Introduction

<img src="assets/images/me.jpg" alt="Photo" hspace="20" width="30%" align="right"/> Hi:)<br>My name is Yilin Du, and I am a first-year master's student in Digital Humanities at University of Helsinki. My previous major was history, with a particular focus on the north-south division in medieval China. Currently, I am exploring digital tools in historical studies to discover the new perspectives they can offer. I am especially passionate about sentiment analysis and network analysis. Additionally, I have a keen interest in archive digitization, aiming to build user-friendly historical databases.
