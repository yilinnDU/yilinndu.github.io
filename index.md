## Introduction

<img src="assets/images/me.jpg" alt="Photo" hspace="20" width="30%" align="right"/> Hi :)<br>My name is Yilin Du, and I am a first-year master's student in Digital Humanities at University of Helsinki. My previous major was history, with a particular focus on the north-south division in medieval China. Currently, I am exploring digital tools in historical studies to discover the new perspectives they can offer. I am especially passionate about sentiment analysis and network analysis. Additionally, I have a keen interest in archive digitization, aiming to build user-friendly historical databases.

## Projects

[cmdline-course](https://github.com/yilinnDU/cmdline-course): this project focuses on processing texts from Project Gutenberg, specifically the book "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland". The project uses a **Makefile** to automate the build process for generating word frequency lists, sentence files, and parsed outputs. The project generates comprehensive output files, such as `all.freq.txt` and `all.sent.txt`, facilitating further analysis of the literary works.
